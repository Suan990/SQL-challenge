# SQL-challenge
Background 
 The task of the SQL challenge is to analyze employee data of the company Pewlett Hackard from 1980 to 1990. The employee data is given in CSV files and my task is to extract the data and perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. 
Data Modeling
  Sketch an entity Relationship diagram of the tables from the CSV files.

   List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
   List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

   List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
   List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
